# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Introduction

Customer churn, the phenomenon where customers stop using a company’s products or services, presents a significant challenge for many businesses. Understanding and predicting churn is crucial as it enables companies to take proactive steps to retain customers, thus reducing revenue loss and improving long-term profitability. This project aims to predict customer churn by analyzing behavioral and demographic data through various machine learning techniques. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset, the project identifies key factors contributing to churn and develops models to accurately predict which customers are at risk of leaving.

## Project Description

This project is focused on the classification of customer churn using various customer-related data points. The process involves meticulous data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of multiple machine learning algorithms to build a robust churn prediction model. The project is implemented using Python, with extensive use of libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to clean the data, explore correlations, and evaluate the performance of different models, ultimately selecting the most effective one for predicting churn.

## Objectives

- **Data Preparation**: Clean and prepare the customer churn dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize and analyze customer behavior and its correlation with churn.
- **Model Building**: Build and compare multiple machine learning models for churn prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance and select the best model for accurate predictions.

## Data Source

The primary dataset was sourced from a telecommunications company, encompassing various customer attributes and their churn status. The dataset includes 7,043 rows and 21 columns, with a binary target variable indicating whether the customer has churned.

- **Data Source:** [Telco Customer Churn Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

## Methodology

### Data Sourcing and Cleaning:
- Data was acquired from a telecommunications industry database.
- Extensive preprocessing was performed to handle missing data, duplicates, and outliers.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Used Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy) for data visualization and analysis.
- Examined the distribution of customer attributes and their relationship with churn.

### Model Building and Evaluation:
- Implemented various machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, k-NN, Naïve Bayes, Neural Networks, and Random Forests.
- Performed feature selection using techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and chi-square tests for dimensionality reduction.
- Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Applied SMOTE to address class imbalance and enhance model performance.

## Key Findings

1. **High Monthly Charges**: Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn, suggesting a need for value reassessment or targeted discounts for high-paying customers.
2. **Contract Type**: Customers on short-term or month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn. Incentivizing longer-term contracts could improve retention.
3. **Service Usage**: Customers who do not use additional services (e.g., MultipleLines, OnlineSecurity) may be more prone to churn. Offering bundled services at a discount might help retain these customers.
4. **Proactive Interventions**: By predicting churn, the company can proactively reach out to at-risk customers before they decide to leave, potentially reducing overall churn rates.
5. **Tenure and Loyalty**: Customers with shorter tenure (e.g., less than a year) are often at higher risk of churn. This suggests that early engagement strategies are crucial.
6. **Payment Method**: Certain payment methods, like month-to-month billing with manual payments, are associated with higher churn rates. Encouraging customers to switch to automated payments could reduce churn.
7. **Internet Service Type**: Customers using certain internet service types (e.g., DSL) are more likely to churn, indicating a potential need for service upgrades or better plans.

## Limitations and Future Work

### Limitations:
- The model's effectiveness relies heavily on the quality and completeness of customer data.
- Potential biases in the dataset due to regional or demographic factors that were not fully accounted for.

### Future Work:
- Investigate additional customer attributes and their impact on churn prediction.
- Explore more advanced machine learning techniques, such as Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) or deep learning models.
- Enhance model interpretability to better understand the influence of individual predictors on churn.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the factors influencing customer churn and demonstrates the application of machine learning for predictive analytics in customer retention. The methodologies and findings can serve as a foundation for further research and the development of more sophisticated churn prediction models, helping businesses proactively retain their customers and reduce churn rates.
